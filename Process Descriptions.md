# Introduction
This document outlines our (v1.0) processes for work prioritisation, assignment and management.
The intention over time is for the process to be implemented on the ServiceNow platform and for further convergence on scaled agile processes for programme and solution backlogs ( http://www.scaledagileframework.com/program-and-solution-backlogs/ ) - the following should be read in that context.

# Process Overview
We use the following process to manage work in the team. The process aims to triage work and break it down in stages into chunks which are deliverable within a PI and then within a single sprint. The aim is to maintain a reasonable and steady delivery progress across the wide range of activities currently being undertaken across consultancy, development and hosting.

Work is surfaced on a series of Kanban boards, 
* the service backlog, showing all work currently in train and 
* the current sprint backog, showing work for the current sprint
* future sprint backlogs showing work scheduled for forthcoming sprints in a PI

As sprints are completed, the boards representing them are archived and new ones created.

The service backlog kanban is used as the overall basket of items to be worked on and contains three main columns:
* the master backlog column 
* The PI column - a list of items that can be delivered over a PI,
* A Sprint column - a list of items that should be deliverable within a sprint. 
Items in the three columns are analogous to Epics, Features and Stories resectively in size and scale. Further columns are added to list done work and work that has been parked (for work that is under consideration but awaiting further analysis or formal go-ahead).

# Sources of Demand
Items on the service backlog are from two sources - eHealth SLA work and NSS internal work. Items can be either New demand, BAU or service improvement. NSS work done under the DTS programme should come in as prioritised by the digital demand stream and as such can be added to the service backlog without further analysis (though will still need to be prioritised as part of the backlog refinement process). eHealth SLA work can come through as new business agreed by the steering group or as fulfillment of existing agreed services.

# Service Backlog Refinement - Funneling and analysis
Senior staff meet fortnightly to discuss current and new demand and agree items on the service backlog. This process acts as the funnel for the service backlog and the process by which new work items are added for acton in forthcoming sprints and by which work is broken-off from epics into deliverable chunks. 
Generally, work that is on the service are larger in scale representing collections of multiple user stories deliverabl over one or more program increments. The multiple stories they represent are shown within an item as a checklist. 
(Where work comes from a legitimate source of demand but additional analysis is required, items that are much smaler in scale migt and potentially deliverable witin a single sprint might be added.)

# PI Backlog
The PI backlog consists ot items broken down from the service backlog into items deliverable over the course of a 12 week programme increment.
We are currently experimenting with the idea of breaking PIs into two-phases of 6 weeks each; PIa and PIb to support greater flexibility in dealing with new demand coming on to the service backlog. (an example would be responding to new threats).

# Tags
Tags are used to categorise items on the lists.
These are filtered to allow for measureent of effort by category. For example, items may be tagged as new demand, bau and service improvement. 
The following tags are in (V1) use

### Labels

* SecurityüëÆ
* KM and DocMgmnt üìô
* Infrastructureüèó
* Governanceü§¥
* Digital developmentüì≥
* Sensitive ü§û
* Mnt and Managementüöú
* New Service Request
* Service Improvement - CSI ü¶Ñ
* Unaccounted for query üíÄ


# Points
Points are assigned at the sprint level. We have agreed in the team to assign 2 points per day worked so for a team of 8 a sprint is worth 160 points (assumes no holidays)
