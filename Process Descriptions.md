# Process Overview
This document outlines our (v1.0) processes for work prioritisation, assignment and management.
The intention over time is for the process to be implemented in service now and for the process to converge on the SAFE processes for programme and solution backlogs http://www.scaledagileframework.com/program-and-solution-backlogs/ - the following should be read in that context.

We use the following process to manage work in the team. Work is surfaced on a two Kanban boards, a master backlog, showing at a  for all work currently in train 

# Sources of Demand
Items on the service backlog are from two sources - eHealth SLA work and NSS internal work. Items can be either New demand, BAU or service improvement. NSS work done under the DTS programme should come in as prioritised by the digital demand stream and as such can be added to the service backlog without further analysis (though will still need to be prioritised as part of the backlog refinement process). eHealth SLA work can come through as new business agreed by the steering group or as fulfillment of existing agreed services.

# Service Backlog - Funneling and analysis
Senior staff meet fortnightly to discuss current and new demand and agree items on the service backlog. This process acts as the funnel into the service backlog. Where work comes from a legitimate source of demand but additional analysis is required, an analysis task is added to the backlog for prioritisation. The backlog contains an item for each project, service currently in scope for the team. Each item is classified as 

# PI Backlog
The PI bakclog cosnsits ot items brokendown from the service backlog into items deliverable over the course of a 12 week programme increment.
We are currently experimenting with the idea of breaking PIs into two-phases of 6 weeks each; PIa and PIb to support greater flexibility in dealing with new demand coming on to the service backlog. (an example would be responding to new threats).


# Sprint Backlog
Items in the PI backlog are 

# Meetings

# Tags
Tags are used to categorise items on the lists.
These are filtered to allow for measureent of effort by category. For example, items may be tagged as new demand, bau and service improvement. 
The following tags are in (V1) use

### Labels

* Security👮🔐
* KM and DocMgmnt 📙📓
* Infrastructure🏗
* Governance🤴
* Digital development📳

# Points
Points are assigned at the sprint level. We have agreed in the team to assign 2 points per day worked so for a team of 8 a sprint is worth 160 points (assumes no holidays)
